We will prove that every integer has a unique \emph{prime factorization}.  

Examples:
\[ 6006 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \]
\[ 144 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \]
\[ 12 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \]

This is also called \emph{the fundamental theorem of arithmetic}.

\[ n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots p_k \]

In the list of the prime factors of $n$, a factor may be repeated.  To compare two factorizations for uniqueness, we suppose they are sorted (say, from smallest to greatest).

Example:

Let's try $123456789$.  

At first it seems easy.  I get two factors of $3$, leaving $13717421$.

Then my luck ran out.  The smallest prime factor was too large for me to find by hand.  I used Python:

\begin {verbatim}
def f(n):
    for i in range(2,int(n**0.5)):
        if n % i == 0:
            print i, n/i
\end{verbatim}

Running this

\begin{verbatim}
>>> f(13717421)
3607 3803
\end{verbatim}

These are the two prime factors of that number.

\subsection*{background}

We will prove that the unique prime factorization theorem is true.

Before we start on that, remember that when we say that one integer evenly \emph{divides} another one, written as $a|n$ or $a$ is a factor of $n$, what we mean is that we can find another integer $k$ such that

\[ a \cdot k = n \]
$a$ times $k$ is exactly equal to $n$.

And if there is also a number $m$ where $a$ evenly divides $m$, we write $a|m$ and mean that
\[ a \cdot j = m \]

So then addition or subtraction of $m + n$ gives
\[ m + n = a \cdot j + a \cdot k = a(k + j) \]
\[ m - n = a \cdot j - a \cdot k = a(k - j) \]
If $a|m$ and $a|n$, $a$ divides their sum or difference.

\subsection*{abnormal numbers}

Hardy and Wright (\emph{Theory of Numbers}, sect. 2:11) have a proof of prime factorization, different than the standard one, which I find quite elegant.

Its greatest virtue is that it simplifies some other proofs including of Euclid's lemma, which is tedious.

Proof.

By contradiction.

Hardy:
\begin{quote}Let us call numbers which can be factored into primes in more than one way, \emph{abnormal}, and let $n$ be the smallest abnormal number.\end{quote}

Start by supposing that there are two different factorizations of $n$:
\[ n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots p_k \]
and
\[ n = q_1 \cdot q_2 \dots q_j \]
where the $p$'s and $q$'s are all primes.

\subsection*{Different factorizations}

As a preliminary result, consider the possibility that some $p$ is equal to a $q$.

Let us rearrange if necessary so that factor is first:  $p_1 = q_1$ and
\[ n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \dots p_k \]
\[ n = p_1 \cdot q_2 \dots q_j \]

But now, $n/p_1$ is abnormal, because it has two different prime factorizations.  

That is impossible, because $n$ is the smallest abnormal number.

Thus, we have that no $p$ is a $q$ and no $q$ is a $p$.

If there do exist abnormal numbers with two factorizations, those factorizations must be completely different.

\subsection*{inequality}

In this part, we establish that $p_1 \cdot q_1 < n$.

We may take $p_1$ to be the least $p$ and $q_1$ to be the least $q$.  

Since $n$ is composite, either $p_1^2 = n$ (and $p_1$ is the only factor of $n$),

Or $p_1$ times the largest $p_k = n$.

In the second case, $p_1 < p_k$, $p_1 \cdot p_k = n$ and so $p_1 \cdot p_1 < n$.

A similar result holds for $q_1$.

But, since $p_1 \ne q_1$, only one of $p_1$ or $q_1$ at most, can be squared to give $n$.  Either $p_1 \cdot p_1 < n$ or $q_1 \cdot q_1 < n$ or if there is more than one $p$ and more than one $q$, both statements are true.

From this it follows that $p_1 \cdot q_1 < n$. 

\subsection*{the contradiction} 

Let $N = n - p_1 q_1$.

We have $0 < N < n$ and also that $N$ is not abnormal.

We're given that $p_1 | n$ and so, from the above equality $N = n - p_1 q_1$ and our preliminary reminder about what factorization means, it must be that $p_1 | N$.

A similar result is true for $q_1$, namely $q_1 | N$.  

Hence both $p_1$ and $q_1$ appear in the unique factorizations of both $N$ and $p_1 q_1$.

We have that $N = n - p_1 q_1$ and we've shown that $p_1 q_1 | N$ and certainly $p_1 q_1 | p_1 q_1$.  It follows that $p_1 q_1 | n$ and hence $q_1 = n/p_1$.  

But $n/p_1$ is less than $n$ and has the unique prime factorization $p_2 \cdot p_3 \dots p_k$.

Since $q_1$ is not a $p$, this is impossible.  

Hence there cannot be any abnormal numbers.

$\square$

This is also called the \emph{fundamental theorem of arithmetic}.
