\section*{Law of cosines}

Designate the lengths of a triangle's sides as $a,b,c$ and the angle between sides $a$ and $b$ as $C$ (because it is opposite side $c$).  The law of cosines says that

\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.5] {cosine_law.png} \end{center}

\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos C \]

Lockhart calls this the "generalized" Pythagorean theorem.  We can view the term $-2ab \cos C$ as a correction term which disappears in the case where $\angle C$ is 90 degrees.

\subsection*{derivation}
The result follows from the Pythagorean Theorem.  (In fact, we can reuse the same diagram that was shown for the algebraic proof of the theorem).

For a triangle with sides $a$, $b$ and $c$ and angles opposite those sides $A$, $B$ and $C$, divide the third side into two lengths $c=d+e$ using the vertical altitude from vertex $C$.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {triangle3.png} \end{center}

\[ a^2 - x^2 = h^2 \]
\[ b^2 - y^2 = h^2  \]

So
\[ a^2 = x^2 + h^2 = x^2 + b^2 - y^2 \]

But
\[ y = c - x \]
\[ y^2 = c^2 - 2cx + x^2 \]

Therefore:
\[ a^2 = x^2 + b^2 - (c^2 - 2cx + x^2) \]
\[ a^2 = b^2 - c^2 + 2cx  \]
Rearranging
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2cx  \]

Finally, $x = a \cos B$ so
\[ a^2 = b^2 - c^2 + 2ac \cos B  \]

This is the law of cosines.

$\square$

Any side of a triangle can be expressed in terms of the other two and the cosine of the angle between them.  Thus, for example
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C  \]
\[ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A  \]

\subsection*{Law of sines}
I'll just mention another identity called the law of sines.  In contrast to the law of cosines, it is fairly trivial.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {triangle4.png} \end{center}

\[ \frac{h}{b} = \sin A \]
\[ \frac{h}{a} = \sin B \]
Therefore
\[ h = b \sin A = a \sin B \]
\[ \frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} \]
We could do the same construction and argument with either $A$ or $B$, and the third angle, call it $C$.  Therefore
\[ \frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} = \frac{\sin C}{c} \]

The sine of an angle, divided by the length of the side opposite, is a constant.
